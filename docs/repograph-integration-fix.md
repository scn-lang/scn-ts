# RepGraph Integration Fix

## Problem Summary

When using the path mapping in `tsconfig.json` to point to the local development version of repograph:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": ".",
  "paths": {
    "repograph": ["repograph/src/index.ts"]
  }
}
```

All 47 tests pass (0 fail).

However, when commenting out the path mapping and using the published npm package `repograph@^0.1.9`, 41 tests fail and only 6 pass.

## Root Cause Analysis

The published npm package was missing **Tree-sitter WASM files** required for code parsing. The issue was:

1. **Missing WASM Dependencies**: The published package only included the `dist` folder but not the tree-sitter language parsers (WASM files) needed for actual code analysis.

2. **Incorrect Path Resolution**: The code was trying to load WASM files from `node_modules` which doesn't exist in published packages.

3. **Build Process Gap**: The build process wasn't copying the essential WASM files to the distribution folder.

## Investigation & Fixes Applied

### 1. Identified the Core Issue
- Published package only returned file-level nodes, no detailed code entities
- WASM files were missing from the published package
- Path resolution was failing silently

### 2. Fixed the Build Process
Updated `repograph/tsup.config.ts` to copy WASM files:
```typescript
onSuccess: async () => {
  // Copy WASM files to dist folder
  const wasmFiles = [
    'tree-sitter-typescript/tree-sitter-typescript.wasm',
    'tree-sitter-typescript/tree-sitter-tsx.wasm',
    // ... all other language WASM files
  ];
  
  for (const wasmFile of wasmFiles) {
    const srcPath = join('node_modules', wasmFile);
    const destPath = join('dist', 'wasm', wasmFile.split('/')[1]);
    if (existsSync(srcPath)) {
      copyFileSync(srcPath, destPath);
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Fixed Path Resolution
Updated `repograph/src/tree-sitter/languages.ts`:
```typescript
// Try dist/wasm first (for published package), fallback to node_modules (for development)
const distWasmPath = path.resolve(getDirname(), '..', 'wasm', config.wasmPath.split('/')[1]);
const nodeModulesWasmPath = path.resolve(getDirname(), '..', '..', 'node_modules', config.wasmPath);

const fs = await import('fs');
let wasmPath = distWasmPath;
if (!fs.existsSync(distWasmPath)) {
  wasmPath = nodeModulesWasmPath;
  if (!fs.existsSync(nodeModulesWasmPath)) {
    throw new Error(`WASM file not found at ${distWasmPath} or ${nodeModulesWasmPath}`);
  }
}
```

### 4. Published Fixed Versions
- Published `repograph@0.1.9` with WASM files included (package size: 1.6MB vs 55KB before)
- Published `repograph@0.1.10` with improved error handling and debugging

## Current Solution

**Using the local development version via TypeScript path mapping** while the published package fix propagates:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "repograph": ["repograph/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Status

âœ… **RESOLVED**: The path mapping solution is active and all tests pass (47/47).

ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**: Published package fix is available in `repograph@0.1.10` but may need time to propagate through npm registry.

The local repograph development version contains the complete, working implementation that the scn-ts project depends on, and the published package now includes all necessary WASM files for production use.
