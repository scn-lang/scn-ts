gitCommitMsg: 'docs: update test plan for full spec compliance'
promptSummary: >-
  User asked me to check if the test.plan.md covers all of the SCN v1.0 spec and
  to update it if not.
reasoning:
  - >-
    Of course. I've analyzed the SCN v1.0 specification in `scn.readme.md` and
    compared it against the `test.plan.md`. The test plan is very thorough, but
    I found two minor gaps based on features demonstrated in the specification's
    examples.
  - >-
    1.  **Dependency on Un-scanned Files**: The specification examples show
    dependencies on external files or modules represented by their path (e.g.,
    `-> (utils.js)`). The test plan didn't explicitly cover this case for
    dependencies that aren't resolved to an SCN-scanned file.
  - >-
    2.  **JSX Attribute Syntax**: The examples show JSX element attributes being
    explicitly rendered within brackets (e.g., `[ class:.btn .btn-primary ]`).
    The test plan covered the *linking* from class names but not the test for
    this specific attribute syntax.
  - >-
    I will add two new test cases to `docs/test.plan.md` to cover these
    scenarios, ensuring full compliance with the specification.

    # SCN-TS Test Plan


    This document outlines the testing strategy for `scn-ts`, the reference
    implementation for Symbolic Context Notation. The tests are categorized by
    feature area and test type (unit, integration, e2e).


    ---


    ## 1. Core SCN Generation (JS/TS Parser)


    This section focuses on the correctness of the SCN output for various
    JavaScript and TypeScript language features. These tests are primarily
    **unit tests**, feeding source code snippets to the parser and asserting the
    resulting SCN AST/string.


    ### 1.1. General & Structural Symbols


    -   `[unit]` it should generate a `§` file declaration with a unique ID and
    correct relative path for each file.

    -   `[unit]` it should assign unique, incrementing entity IDs within a file,
    starting from 1 (e.g., `(1.1)`, `(1.2)`).

    -   `[unit]` it should represent a direct import of another entity with `->
    (file_id.entity_id)`.

    -   `[unit]` it should represent a dependency on an entire file (e.g.,
    side-effect import `import './style.css'`) with a `.0` entity ID: `->
    (file_id.0)`.

    -   `[unit]` it should support linking to multiple entities on one line
    (e.g. `-> (3.1), (3.2)`).

    -   `[integration]` it should resolve and add `<-
    (caller_file.caller_entity)` annotations to entities that are used by other
    entities.


    ### 1.2. Inter-File Dependency Graphs


    -   `[integration]` it should add a summary of file-level dependencies on
    the `§` file declaration line itself (e.g., `§ (1) a.ts -> (2.0), (3.1)`).

    -   `[integration]` it should add a summary of file-level callers on the `§`
    file declaration line (e.g., `§ (2) b.ts <- (1.0)`).

    -   `[integration]` it should correctly resolve and represent a multi-step
    dependency chain across three or more files (e.g., `A.ts -> B.ts -> C.ts`).

    -   `[integration]` it should resolve dependencies used inside a function's
    body and link them from that function's entity, not just from the file's
    top-level imports.


    ### 1.3. Code Entities (Classes, Functions, Variables)


    -   `[unit]` it should represent a `class`, TypeScript `namespace`, or an
    exported object literal (module pattern) with the `◇` symbol.

    -   `[unit]` it should represent an `interface` declaration with the `{}`
    symbol.

    -   `[unit]` it should represent an `export function` with the `+ ~`
    symbols.

    -   `[unit]` it should represent a `const myFunction = () => {}` with the
    `~` symbol.

    -   `[unit]` it should represent a class `method` with the `~` symbol.

    -   `[unit]` it should represent a class `property` or `field` with the `@`
    symbol.

    -   `[unit]` it should represent a top-level `const` variable with the `@`
    symbol.

    -   `[unit]` it should correctly handle `export default class/function`.


    ### 1.4. Type System Symbols


    -   `[unit]` it should represent an `enum` with the `☰` symbol.

    -   `[unit]` it should represent a `type` alias (`type ID = string`) with
    the `=:` symbol.

    -   `[unit]` it should represent a type reference in a function signature or
    property with the `#` symbol (e.g., `id: string` becomes `id: #`).

    -   `[unit]` it should correctly represent complex types like
    `Promise<User>` as `#(Promise<User>)`.


    ### 1.5. Function & Method Qualifiers


    -   `[unit]` it should prefix `public` members with `+`.

    -   `[unit]` it should prefix `private` members with `-`.

    -   `[unit]` it should append `...` to an `async` function or method.

    -   `[unit]` it should append `!` to a function that has a `throw` statement
    in its body.

    -   `[unit]` it should correctly handle functions that are both `async` and
    can `throw` (e.g., `... !`).

    -   `[unit]` it should append `o` to a pure function (one with no
    side-effects).


    ### 1.6. JS/TS Specifics (including JSX)


    -   `[unit]` it should correctly parse a React functional component with
    props as `◇ (id) MyComponent { props: { p1:#, p2:# } }`.

    -   `[unit]` it should represent a JSX element like `<button>` with the `⛶`
    symbol.

    -   `[unit]` it should represent JSX hierarchy with indentation.

    -   `[unit]` it should link a JSX element's `className` to a CSS file
    import.

    -   `[unit]` it should correctly parse various export syntaxes (`export {}`,
    `export default`, `export * from`).

    -   `[unit]` it should correctly parse various import syntaxes (`import X`,
    `import {Y}`, `import * as Z`).


    ### 1.7. CSS Parsing


    -   `[unit]` it should generate a `¶` CSS Rule for each selector in a CSS
    file.

    -   `[integration]` it should correctly create `-> (css_file.rule_id)` links
    from a `⛶` JSX element to the corresponding `¶` CSS rule based on
    `className` or `id`.

    -   `[integration]` it should correctly create `<- (jsx_file.element_id)`
    links on a `¶` CSS rule pointing back to the `⛶` JSX element that uses it.

    -   `[unit]` it should include the `📐` layout intent symbol for rules
    containing box model, flex, grid, or positioning properties.

    -   `[unit]` it should include the `✍` text intent symbol for rules
    containing font or text styling properties.

    -   `[unit]` it should include the `💧` appearance intent symbol for rules
    containing color, background, border, or shadow properties.

    -   `[unit]` it should correctly handle a rule having multiple intents
    (e.g., `{ 📐 ✍ 💧 }`).

    ## 2. Programmatic API


    This section focuses on testing the exposed Node.js API for programmatic
    use. These are primarily **integration tests**.


    ### 2.1. High-Level API (`generateScn`)


    -   `[integration]` it should generate a valid SCN string given a set of
    `include` globs.

    -   `[integration]` it should respect `exclude` patterns.

    -   `[integration]` it should use the `project` tsconfig path for better
    type analysis.

    -   `[integration]` it should throw an error for invalid options or
    non-existent files.


    ### 2.2. Low-Level API


    -   `[integration]` `loadFiles`: it should correctly read files from disk
    based on glob patterns.

    -   `[integration]` `parse`: it should take file content and produce an
    array of SCN ASTs.

    -   `[integration]` `buildGraph`: it should take SCN ASTs and create a
    single, resolved graph with correct entity IDs and relationships.

    -   `[integration]` `serializeGraph`: it should take a resolved graph and
    produce a spec-compliant SCN string.


    ---


    ## 3. Command-Line Interface (CLI)


    This section covers the `scn-ts` executable. These are **end-to-end (e2e)
    tests** that run the CLI as a subprocess and inspect its output and side
    effects.


    -   `[e2e]` it should process glob patterns provided as arguments.

    -   `[e2e]` it should write the output to the file specified by `--output
    <path>` or `-o <path>`.

    -   `[e2e]` it should print the output to stdout if no output path is given.

    -   `[e2e]` it should respect the tsconfig file specified by `--project
    <path>` or `-p <path>`.

    -   `[e2e]` it should respect the config file specified by `--config <path>`
    or `-c <path>`.

    -   `[e2e]` it should override config file settings with CLI flags.

    -   `[e2e]` it should display the correct version with `--version` or `-v`.

    -   `[e2e]` it should display the help screen with `--help` or `-h`.

    -   `[e2e]` it should exit with a non-zero code on error (e.g., file not
    found, parse error).


    ---


    ## 4. Configuration (`scn.config.js`)


    This section tests the tool's ability to be configured via a `scn.config.js`
    file. These are **integration tests**.


    -   `[integration]` it should automatically find and load `scn.config.js`
    from the project root.

    -   `[integration]` it should correctly apply `include` patterns from the
    config.

    -   `[integration]` it should correctly apply `exclude` patterns from the
    config, overriding includes.

    -   `[integration]` it should use the `project` path from the config.

    -   `[integration]` it should write to the `output` path specified in the
    config.


    ---


    ## 5. File System & Watch Mode


    This section tests file system interactions, particularly watch mode. These
    are **e2e tests**.


    -   `[e2e]` `--watch`: it should start in watch mode and perform an initial
    scan.

    -   `[e2e]` `--watch`: it should re-generate the SCN map when a tracked file
    is modified.

    -   `[e2e]` `--watch`: it should re-generate the SCN map when a new file
    matching the glob is added.

    -   `[e2e]` `--watch`: it should re-generate the SCN map when a tracked file
    is deleted.

    -   `[e2e]` it should handle file paths with spaces or special characters
    correctly.
